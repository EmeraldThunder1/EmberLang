# EmberLang

EmberLang is a text based programming language meant to be easy for beginners to pick up but also for advanced users, providing a wide and extensive feature set. It is based on the scrtahc programming language and compiles directly to the .sb3 format scratch uses.

Ember is designed with a syntax very similar to that of JavaScript or C# which provides a good entry point into the world of more advanced programming languages.

Ember 2 will be packaged with a powerful addon system which allows for nearly endless customisation of the languages features in a way which is also easy for beginner programmers to pick up. The JSON system means that no actual programming is neccessary in a wide range of use cases, although Ember code can be used to quickly create large and compilcated functions without needing to know any details about the scratch internal engine.
