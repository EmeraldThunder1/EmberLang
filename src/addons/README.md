# Ember addons

Addons are a way to add new functions and features to Ember. You can download addons by using the `emberLang install <addon-name>` command that is built into the Ember download. You can also install addons by dropping the folder into the addons folder in your installation directory.

## Default addons

A variety of addons come with the Ember installation and provide some useful features for your application. The following addons are included:

vectors
jsonParser
graphics2d
cloudInterface
mathsExtension

The documentation for these addons are available on the emberLang website.

Addons use JSON files to describe their functionality which means they are both simple to code and easily readable.
